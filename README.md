# BCC - Educational Center Landing Page

This project is a pixel-perfect implementation of the Baku Code Center (BCC) landing page, developed based on specific Figma design requirements. It features a modern, fully responsive layout with interactive elements.

##  Project Overview

The current implementation focuses on the **Home Page (`index.html`)**, serving as the main entry point for the website. The design prioritizes user experience across all devices (Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile), ensuring visual consistency with the provided design mockups.

### Key Features
*   **Responsive Header:** Includes a sticky navigation bar, language switcher, and a fully functional hamburger menu for mobile devices.
*   **Hero Section:** Features a custom image slider and a uniquely styled "Bizimlə Təəccüblən" title with a stepped, polygon background effect.
*   **Stats Section:** A detailed statistics area with a city illustration background and decorative elements.
*   **Interactive Components:** Hover effects on cards, buttons, and navigation links.
*   **Clean Layouts:** Utilizes CSS Grid and Flexbox for sections like Features, Partners, About, and Blog.
*   **Subscription Form:** A styled newsletter subscription input in the footer.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

*   **CSS3:** Custom styling without external frameworks.

    *   Media Queries for responsiveness (Mobile & Tablet adaptations).
    *   Advanced styling for "pixel-perfect" design matching.
*   **JavaScript (Vanilla):**
    *   Mobile menu toggling logic.

    *   Slider functionality (if applicable).
